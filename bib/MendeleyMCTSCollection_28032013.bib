annote = {We describe a novel approach for designing network control algorithms that incorporate traffic models. Traffic models can be viewed as stochastic predictions about the future network state, and can be used to generate traces of potential future network behavior. Our approach is to use such traces to heuristically evaluate candidate control actions using a technique called hindsight optimization. In hindsight optimization, the finite-horizon "utility" achievable from a given system state is estimated by averaging estimates obtained from a number of traces starting at the state. For each trace, the utility value of the state is estimated by determining the optimal "hindsight control"-this is the control that would be applied by an optimal controller that somehow "knew" the whole trace beforehand-and then measuring the utility obtained under that control. Averaging over many samples then gives a simulation-based "hindsight-optimal" utility for the starting state that upper bounds the true utility value of the state. This technique for estimating state utility can then be used to select the control-simply select the control that gives the highest utility. Our hindsight-optimization approach to designing simulation-based control algorithms can be applied to a wide variety of network decision problems. We present empirical results showing effectiveness for two example control problems-multiclass scheduling and congestion control.},

abstract = {Many enhancements to the alpha-beta algorithm have been proposed to help reduce the size of minimax trees. A recent enhance- ment, the history heuristic, is described that improves the order in which branches are considered at interior nodes. A comprehensive set of experiments is reported which tries all combinations of enhance- ments to determine which one yields the best performance. Previous work on assessing their performance has concentrated on the benefits of individual enhancements or a few combinations. However, each en- hancement should not be taken in isolation; one would like to find the combination that provides the greatest reduction in tree size. Results indicate that the history heuristic and transposition tables significantly outperform other alpha-beta enhancements in application generated game trees. For trees up to depth 9, when taken together, they account for 99 percent of the possible reductions in tree size, with the other enhancements yielding insignificant gains.},

abstract = {In this paper we apply a Monte-Carlo Tree Search implementation that is boosted with domain knowledge to the game of poker. More specifically, we integrate an opponent model in the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to produce a strong poker playing program. Opponent models allow the search algorithm to focus on relevant parts of the game-tree. We use an opponent modelling approach that starts from a (learned) prior, i.e., general expectations about opponent behavior, and then learns a relational regression tree-function that adapts these priors to specific opponents. Our modelling approach can generate detailed game features or relations on-the-fly. Additionally, using a prior we can already make reasonable predictions even when limited experience is available for a particular player. We show that Monte-Carlo Tree Search with integrated opponent models performs well against stateof- the-art poker programs.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of AI, mind games have been studied as relevant application fields. Nowadays, some programs are better than human players in most classical games. Their results highlight the efficiency of AI methods that are now quite standard. Such methods are very useful to Go programs, but they do not enable a strong Go program to be built. The problems related to Computer Go require new AI problem solving methods. Given the great number of problems and the diversity of possible solutions, Computer Go is an attractive research domain for AI. Prospective methods of programming the game of Go will probably be of interest in other domains as well. The goal of this paper is to present Computer Go by showing the links between existing studies on Computer Go and different AI related domains: evaluation function, heuristic search, machine learning, automatic knowledge generation, mathematical morphology and cognitive science. In addition, this paper describes both the practical aspects of Go programming, such as program optimization, and various theoretical aspects such as combinatorial game theory, mathematical morphology, and Monte Carlo methods.},

@article{Yoshida2008,
abstract = {This paper introduces a model of 'theory of mind', namely, how we represent the intentions and goals of others to optimise our mutual interactions. We draw on ideas from optimum control and game theory to provide a 'game theory of mind'. First, we consider the representations of goals in terms of value functions that are prescribed by utility or rewards. Critically, the joint value functions and ensuing behaviour are optimised recursively, under the assumption that I represent your value function, your representation of mine, your representation of my representation of yours, and so on ad infinitum. However, if we assume that the degree of recursion is bounded, then players need to estimate the opponent's degree of recursion (i.e., sophistication) to respond optimally. This induces a problem of inferring the opponent's sophistication, given behavioural exchanges. We show it is possible to deduce whether players make inferences about each other and quantify their sophistication on the basis of choices in sequential games. This rests on comparing generative models of choices with, and without, inference. Model comparison is demonstrated using simulated and real data from a 'stag-hunt'. Finally, we note that exactly the same sophisticated behaviour can be achieved by optimising the utility function itself (through prosocial utility), producing unsophisticated but apparently altruistic agents. This may be relevant ethologically in hierarchal game theory and coevolution.},

@inproceedings{Powley2011,
abstract = {Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a class of game tree search algorithms that have recently proven successful for deterministic games of perfect information, particularly the game of Go. Determinization is an AI technique for making decisions in stochastic games of imperfect information by analysing several instances of the equivalent deterministic game of perfect information. In this paper we combine determinization techniques with MCTS for the popular Chinese card game Dou Di Zhu. In determinized MCTS, there is a trade-off between the number of determinizations searched and the time spent searching each one; however, we show that this trade-off does not significantly affect the performance of determinized MCTS, as long as both quantities are sufficiently large. We also show that the ability to see opponents’ hidden cards in Dou Di Zhu is a significant advantage, which suggests that inference techniques could potentially lead to much stronger play.},

annote = {We consider the burst-level congestion-control problem in a communication network with multiple traffic sources, each modeled as a fully controllable stream of fluid traffic. The controlled traffic shares a common bottleneck node with high-priority cross traffic described by a Markov-modulated fluid (MMF). Each controlled source is assumed to have a unique round-trip delay. The goal is to maximize a linear combination of the throughputs delay, traffic-loss rate, and a fairness metric at the bottleneck node. We introduce a simulation-based congestion-control scheme capable of performing effectively under rapidly varying cross traffic by making use of the provided MMF model of that variation. The control problem is posed as a finite-horizon Markov decision process, and is solved heuristically using a technique called Hindsight Optimization. We provide a detailed derivation of our congestion-control algorithm based on this technique. Our empirical study shows that the control scheme performs significantly better than the conventional proportional-derivative (PD) congestion-control method.},

@article{Lee2009,
abstract = {In order to promote computer Go and stimulate fur- ther development and research in the field, the event activities, Computational Intelligence Forum andWorld 9 9 Computer Go Championship, were held in Taiwan. This study focuses on the in- vited games played in the tournamentTaiwaneseGoPlayersVersus the Computer Program MoGo held at the National University of Tainan (NUTN), Tainan, Taiwan. Several Taiwanese Go players, including one 9-Dan (9D) professional Go player and eight am- ateur Go players, were invited by NUTN to play against MoGo from August 26 to October 4, 2008. The MoGo program combines all-moves-as-first (AMAF)/rapid action value estimation (RAVE) values, online “upper confidence tree (UCT)-like” values, offline values extracted from databases, and expert rules. Additionally, four properties of MoGo are analyzed including: 1) the weakness in corners, 2) the scaling over time, 3) the behavior in handicap games, and 4) the main strength of MoGo in contact fights. The results reveal that MoGo can reach the level of 3 Dan (3D) with: 1) good skills for fights, 2) weaknesses in corners, in particular, for “semeai” situations, and 3) weaknesses in favorable situations such as handicap games. It is hoped that the advances in AI and com- putational power will enable considerable progress in the field of computer Go, with the aim of achieving the same levels as com- puter Chess or Chinese Chess in the future.},

@article{Auer2002,
abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

abstract = {An extention of the alpha-beta tree pruning strategy to game trees with ‘probability’ nodes, whose values are defined as the (possibly weighted) average of their successors' values, is developed. These ‘*-minimax’ trees pertain to games involving chance but no concealed information. Based upon our search strategy, we formulate and then analyze several algorithms for *-minimax trees. An initial left-to-right depth-first algorithm is developed and shown to reduce the complexity of an exhaustive search strategy by 25–30 percent. An improved algorithm is then formulated to ‘probe’ beneath the chance nodes of ‘regular’ *-minimax trees, where players alternate in making moves with chance events interspersed. With random ordering of successor nodes, this modified algorithm is shown to reduce search by more than 50 percent. With optimal ordering, it is shown to reduce search complexity by an order of magnitude. After examining the savings of the first two algorithms on deeper trees, two additional algorithms are presented and analyzed.},

It combines efficiently expert rules, patterns extracted from datasets, All-Moves-As-First values, and classical online values. As this improved bandit formula does not solve several important situations (semeais, nakade) in computer Go, we present three other important improvements which are central in the recent progress of our program MoGo. • We show an expert-based improvement of Monte-Carlo simulations for nakade situations; we also emphasize some limitations of this modification. • We show a technique which preserves diversity in the Monte-Carlo simulation, which greatly improves the results in 19x19. • Whereas the UCB-based exploration term is not efficient in MoGo, we show a new exploration term which is highly efficient in MoGo. MoGo recently won a game with handicap 7 against a 9Dan Pro player, Zhou JunXun, winner of the LG Cup 2007, and a game with handicap 6 against a 1Dan pro player, Li-Chen Chien.},
